# Global Mean Sea Level Pressure

## Exploring Global Mean Sea Level Pressure in the ERA of Climate Change

Climate change stands as one of the most critical challenges confronting our planet, having profound impacts on various aspects of ecosystems and atmospheric conditions. Within this complex syste,, mean sea level pressure (MSLP) emerges as a pivotal variable, embodying crucial insights into climatic shifts. MSLP captures alterations in air pressure at sea level directly influencing regional and global weather systems, including wind patterns, storm formation, and precipitation distribution. Predicting changes in mean sea level pressure (MSLP) is vital for preparing for shifts in climate conditions and anticipating extreme weather events. 

This project examines historical MSLP data and climate models to reveal subtle changes in pressure patterns spanning approximately 60 years. Through this analysis, we aim to understand how MSLP variations might impact weather systems, atmospheric circulation, and potentially regional precipitation. Temporal and spatial analyses to MSLP will be applied to understand trends, anomalies, and variations over time. Moreover, the project employ comparisons between historical MSLP observations and model simulations.
