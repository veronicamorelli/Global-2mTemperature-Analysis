## Exploring Global Surface Temperature in the ERA of Climate Change

Climate change poses a formidable challenge to our planet, particularly affecting temperature patterns and exerting profound influences on various ecological and atmospheric facets. In the realm of temperature analysis, surface temperature stands out as a key variable, offering critical insights into climatic dynamics. Surface temperature variations impact a multitude of environmental processes, including heat distribution, energy transfer, and the frequency of heatwaves or cold spells. Anticipating and comprehending alterations in surface temperature is crucial for adapting to changing climate conditions and predicting the occurrence of extreme heat or cold events.

This research endeavor delves into historical surface temperature data and employs climate models to unravel nuanced shifts in temperature patterns over the course of several decades. The objective is to discern the intricate ways in which surface temperature changes might influence broader climatic phenomena, atmospheric circulation, and potentially regional temperature extremes. Temporal and spatial analyses will be applied to surface temperature data to identify trends, anomalies, and variations over time. Furthermore, the project involves comparisons between observed historical surface temperature records and simulations generated by climate models, providing a comprehensive perspective on the dynamics of temperature changes in the studied period.
